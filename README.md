## üõ† Tools for the Course

To ensure a smooth learning experience, you may use the following tools:

- **Visual Studio Code**: An editor that supports Python and Jupyter notebooks. [Download Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
- **Replit**: An online IDE for writing, running, and sharing code. [Start with Replit for Education](https://replit.com/site/teams-for-education).
- **VSCode Web**: Code directly in your browser with [VSCode Web](https://vscode.dev).

## üîó Connecting Replit to GitHub Classroom

Submitting assignments through GitHub Classroom is easy once your Replit account is linked to GitHub. Follow these steps to connect your accounts:

**Note**: School accounts may have restrictions. Using personal accounts for this course may be more effective.

## üåü Getting Started

Dive into "Variables and Data Types" by exploring the `theory.ipynb` notebook. Enhance your learning with practical examples, and challenge yourself with exercises:

- Review theoretical concepts in `theory.ipynb`.
- Explore practical applications in the `examples/` directory.
- Test your understanding with exercises in the `exercises/` directory.
- Verify your solutions in the `solutions/` directory. Attempt the exercises independently before consulting the solutions.

## üí° Need Help?

The Computer Science department team encourages all students to seek help and engage deeply with the course material. We're here to support your learning journey:

- **Ask for Help**: Never hesitate to ask for help. Whether you're stuck on a problem or need clarification on a concept, we're here to assist.
- **Extra Work**: We encourage you to go beyond the coursework. Tackling additional problems and projects can significantly enhance your understanding and skills.
- **We're Here to Help**: Our team is dedicated to supporting you. Reach out through issues in the repository, or contact us directly for guidance.

## üõ† Recommended VS Code Extensions

To enhance your Python coding experience in Visual Studio Code, we recommend the following extensions. These extensions provide support for Markdown preview, Python development, linting, sorting imports, running Jupyter notebooks, and more:

- **GitHub Markdown Preview** - `bierner.markdown-preview-github-styles`: Provides a GitHub-style preview for Markdown files, making documentation more readable.

- **Flask Snippets** - `cstrap.flask-snippets`: Offers snippets for Flask, enhancing productivity when working with this Python web framework.

- **GitHub Copilot** - `github.copilot`: Acts as your AI pair programmer, assisting with Python code and more.

- **Python Test Adapter** - `littlefoxteam.vscode-python-test-adapter`: Integrates with the Test Explorer UI to run Python tests directly from VS Code.

- **Debugpy** - `ms-python.debugpy`: An implementation of the Debug Adapter Protocol, enabling debugging of Python applications.

- **Flake8 Linting** - `ms-python.flake8`: Provides linting for Python using flake8, helping to catch coding errors and enforce style conventions.

- **Isort** - `ms-python.isort`: Automatically sorts imports alphabetically and separates them into sections, improving code organization.

- **Python** - `ms-python.python`: Offers comprehensive support for Python development in VS Code, including IntelliSense, linting, debugging, and more.
